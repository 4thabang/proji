# Proji class template file

# The actual class name.
# Must be unique and expressive.
# name = "myTestClass" <- Good
# name = "t1"          <- Bad, too short and not expressive


# One or more short class labels. Labels must be unique and
# should ideally be descriptive. These labels will be
# used later on to create your projects.
# e.g.: proji create YOUR-LABEL my-new-project
# The first label will be used as the default file extension.
# labels = ["mtc"]                <- Good
# labels = ["mtc", "tc"]          <- Okay, 'tc' is not directly derived from class name
# labels = ["myTestClassLabel"]   <- Bad - too long
# labels = ["ilt"]                <- Bad - unrelated to class name
# labels = ["mtc", "mtc"]         <- Invalid - Labels not unique


[folders]
# Folders to create in or copy to the project folder.
# Target is a relative path inside the project folder.
# Template is a relative path inside the configs template folder.
# (~/.config/proji/templates/)
# If you don't want to create a folder by copying a template, just leave
# out the template field and only specify the target. This will create an
# empty file.

# Synatx: "TARGET" = "TEMPLATE"
# "myNewFolder/" = ""                <- no template, just create the file
# "myTargetFolder/" = "templateName" <- copy template to target location


[files]
# Files to create in or copy to the project folder.
# See [folders] for instructions.

# "text/myFile.txt" = ""
# "myTargetFile.txt" = "templateFile.txt"


[scripts]
# Scripts you want to execute after the project structure was created.
# First value should be a script that lies inside the scripts folder.
# The second value is of type boolean and should be true or false
# respectively if the script needs to be executed as root or not.

# Syntax: "SCRIPTNAME" = RUN_AS_SUDO
# "myScript.sh" = false    <- run my script as regular user
# "mySudoScript.sh" = true <- run my script as root
